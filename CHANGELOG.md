## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-01
### Added
- **Monetization (Module 1):** Implemented `SubscriptionScreen` paywall onboarding flow with dynamic routing for Player (`home`) and Organization (`org-portal`) accounts.
- **Monetization (Module 1):** Added global `ProBadge` UI component with adaptive sizing (`sm` and `md`) for feeds and profiles.
- **Monetization (Module 2):** Implemented `useSubscriptionLimits` mock hook to restrict 'FREE' tier organizers to 1 active tournament.
- **Monetization (Module 2):** Built mobile-responsive `LimitReachedDialog` to intercept tournament creation and drive premium upgrades.
- **Monetization (Module 3):** Implemented "Pay-to-Promote" feature allowing Organizers to boost tournament visibility via a one-off fee.
- **Monetization (Module 3):** Created `PromoteDialog` checkout flow with responsive mobile styling.
- **Monetization (Module 3):** Updated `HomeScreen` discovery feed logic to pin `isPromoted` tournaments to the top of the list.
- **UI/UX:** Added premium visual flair (gold gradient borders and tags) to promoted event cards.
- **Data:** Updated `mockData.ts` `Game` interface to support the `isPromoted` boolean.
- **Data:** Updated `mockData.ts` to include `subscriptionTier` ('FREE' | 'PREMIUM') across User and Organization interfaces.

### Changed
- **Architecture:** Deprecated internal rating/reward states within `QueueScreen` to enforce a single source of truth for post-game flows.
- **Routing:** Bridged `QueueScreen` MVP voting to the global application router via `onFinishGame`.
- **Routing:** Fixed `App.tsx` to conditionally route Hosts to `PostGameSummaryScreen` and Participants to `ParticipantFeedbackScreen`.
- **UX:** Chained the Participant flow so users rate the Organizer first, then seamlessly proceed to rate their teammates.
- **Data:** Expanded mock participant data to simulate full 10-player rosters for accurate UI testing.
- **UI Polish:** Refined `LimitReachedDialog` with mobile-first constraints, heavy `rounded-[2rem]` geometry, and centered iconography.
- **UI Bug Fixes:** Forced `bg-[#10b981]` emerald overrides on primary buttons using `!` and inline styles to ensure visibility across all device states.
- **Grammar & UX:** Updated organization dashboard visual cues to cleaner "Free Limit Reached (X/Y)" format.
